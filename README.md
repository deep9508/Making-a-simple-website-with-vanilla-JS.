Lazy Loading To Avoid Pagination (vanilla js)

one should be able to click on any of the buttons of the three pricing tables, and fill in a form.
Use a slider - which should allow user to scroll between the number of users - and suppose if the number of users are 0-10, then the first plan should get highlighted, 10-20, the second plan should get highlighted, and so on.

To avoid pagination, Frontend devs came up with the solution of lazy loading, so when a user reaches the end of the page, more results are automatically loaded to have a good user experience.
